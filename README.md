# Welcome to Sparta Program - Concactination & Interpolation
- Timings
- 30 Minutes

## Summary
Amazing, let's assign some variables, promp the user for input and print some strings!

## Tasks
### Version 1 specs - with concatenation
- define a variable name, and assign a string
- re assign the original variable with your name
- use concatenation to print a welcome message and use methods to format the name/input (remove white spaces)

### Version 2 - with interpolation
- define another variable full_name to a random string
- re assign the variable full_name to a name
- use interpolation to print the message
hint: use psudo code!

### Refractor the code!
- The variables should never have trailing empty spaces
- The variables should always have the first letter capitalized
- we should be able to input several names and all have the first letter capitalized
## Acceptance Criteria
- The program defines the variables name and full_name
- The program re assinged variables name and full_name
- The program capitalizes names
- The program outputs a welcome message
